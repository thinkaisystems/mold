The anomaly detection engine based on Machine Learning

Hi, Welcome to mold - The ML based anomaly engine to find anonalies in data pattern, outliers in security space and much more. We are in the process of designing this product to support multiple data systems. At present our powerful system supports belwo 2 data sources:

1. Kafka topics.
2. File-based input.

How to run Anomlay Detection Engine:
1. Install node.js and run node package.json, the UI is accesible in default port 3000.
2. Install Mongo DB and configure the connection. This serves as model backend and store the desired metrics for further dashboarding

We will soon integrate Grafana for dashboarding.

Happy to contribute - Team ThinkAI
